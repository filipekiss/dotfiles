# Like git-pull but show a short and sexy log of changes
# immediately after merging (git-up) or rebasing (git-reup).

# This version ALWAYS use `git pull --rebase` since you probably shouldn't be merging remotes into
# local branches anyway. Just uncomment Line #23 if you wish to get original behavior
