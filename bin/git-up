# Usage: git-up

# Like git-pull but show a short and sexy log of changes
# immediately after merging (git-up) or rebasing (git-reup).

# This version ALWAYS use `git pull --rebase` since you probably shouldn't be merging remotes into
# local branches anyway. Just uncomment Line #23 if you wish to get original behavior

# show diffstat of all changes if we're pulling with --rebase. not
# sure why git-pull only does this when merging.

# show an abbreviated commit log of stuff that was just merged.
